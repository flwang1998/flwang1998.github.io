The successful integration of a laser into the silicon photonic chip has long been the holy grail of silicon photonics. Among the various methods addressing this challenge, silicon nanocrystal (Si NC) lasers remain a tempting but debated topic due to their complex carrier recombination process. Here we demonstrate an optically pumped edge-emitting first-order distributed feedback Si NC laser by utilizing a versatile nanoimprint lithography method incorporating a composite working stamp. Upon femtosecond pulsed laser pumping, we find that the lasing threshold in exciton number per NC down to 0.021 is unusually low compared with other quantum dot gain materials. To understand this interesting behavior, we have performed systematic transient spectrum experiments on its photoluminescence and transient absorption aimed at revealing the role of self-trapping states in the carrier recombination process. Our results suggest that such states in well passivated Si NCs can be regarded as metastable states that intercept hot electrons and with a time delay, release them back to the conduction band, acting like electron reservoirs that continuously feed the active lasing state as its upper levels. In this perspective, we conclude that the surface states can benefit the buildup of population inversion and lead to inhibition of the Auger process as they temporarily localize the hot electrons outside the NC core and have verified our conclusion by numerical and experimental results, respectively. Our results provide critical information on processes related to Si NC lasing and will aid attempts at Si lasers on-chip.


将激光器成功地集成到硅光子芯片中，长期以来一直是硅光子学的圣杯。在应对这一挑战的各种方法中，硅纳米晶体（Si NC）激光器由于其复杂的载流子重组过程，仍然是一个诱人但有争议的话题。在这里，我们利用一种多功能的纳米压印光刻方法，结合一个复合工作印章，展示了一个光学泵浦边缘发射的一阶分布式反馈硅纳米晶激光器。在飞秒脉冲激光泵浦下，我们发现，与其他量子点增益材料相比，每个NC的激子数低至0.021的激光阈值异常低。为了理解这种有趣的行为，我们对其光致发光和瞬时吸收进行了系统的瞬时光谱实验，旨在揭示载流子重组过程中自我捕获状态的作用。我们的结果表明，在钝化良好的Si NCs中的这种状态可以被视为可转移的状态，它拦截热电子，并在有时间延迟的情况下，将它们释放回传导带，就像电子库一样，不断地将活跃的发光状态作为其上层的能量。从这个角度来看，我们得出结论，表面状态可以有利于群体反转的积累，并导致抑制Auger过程，因为它们暂时将热电子定位在NC核心之外，并分别通过数值和实验结果验证了我们的结论。我们的结果提供了与Si NC发光有关的关键信息，并将有助于在芯片上进行Si激光器的尝试。
